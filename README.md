This is a repo to store all our code.
We are a small group of people who work together in a team to enhance our problem solving and teamwork skills. The hope of this project, 'Paralax', is that eventually as the years go by, we form a bigger and better team who can solve bigger and better problems.

In terms of what kinds of projects we do, well part of the reason is to learn as well, so we do pretty much any project as long as its related to python.
Why python? Simply because, it may overwhelm newcomers to see that they must be afluent in x or y programming language as well. Whereas if its just python, even if they aren't very good at it, they would be able to help in some way or the other, as all of the project would be based on it.

Want to join our community and be a part of a team?
Heres our discord server --> https://discord.gg/zyJmCbJ88f
You will be allowed to chat once you are verified by us :)

## Finished projects

- 500 fixed response project

  It is basically an auto response bot, that can also 'learn'. If there is a question that the bot is unaware of, it will ask you to teach it instead of dismissing it with 'I don't know'. The knowledge that you entered into the bot, will be stored, so all you have to do is re-run the program to use it

## Ongoing projects

- Paralax-bot
The paralax bot is a simple discord bot that has multiple commands(about 70-80), and I felt was a great project to work on as a team. After setting it up, the main programmers being 404, Ray and myself, we were able to get through things quickly, as we were all sorta good at python already.

- Tetris

- Safe Chat Application

  We call it a 'safe' chat application, because our idea is that only people with the same wifi can connect, and chat in this application. This is highly in convinient, and impractical, it cannot be actually sold, since no one, is actually gonna only want to be able to message people in their house only. We are using pyQt5 and sockets, again, the main people working on this, are, me(blankRiot96) and rayzchen. Me, working on the servers and clients, while he works on the GUI.

## Planned projects

- Django/Flask Website
- Platformer Game
- multiplayer snake game
- Multiplayer games (tic tac toe, 2d racing game etc)

## About Our Team:

- We Found each other on discord, when I(blankRiot96) went around posting invites to get a small group of people who might be interested in programming together. The name 'Paralax' was decided by us about 1 week after working with each other. We are just a small programming group who enjoy making projects, for no commercial use at all. This is a way of both learning python and gaining experience in working with teams. You could think of it this way, what you could normally do by yourself, its much better and more efficient to do with others. For example, when making a project, there may be some componenets you both don't know, and dont want to know. With a team, these parts can be done by your teammate! Plus you get an idea of how this is used. 

- The main programmers are rayzchen and blankRiot96(myself), the person who contributes the most to data is LegendryCuber20, also the first one to accept my request and join the team. 

- Our workflow is pretty simple, everyday we have certain amount of work assigned to us, by each other. And its our task to finish it. We have a discord server where we discuss multiple things, like project ideas, and we help each other with our work.
